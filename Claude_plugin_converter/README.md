# Claude Plugin Converter

This directory contains utilities for converting Claude-style plugins (skills and commands) to other CLI formats.

## Supported Targets

- [Gemini CLI](./to_gemini_cli/): Tools to migrate Claude skills and commands to the Gemini CLI format.

## Overview

The tools here are designed to bridge the gap between different LLM CLI ecosystems, allowing users to leverage specialized knowledge-work plugins across various platforms.

While currently focused on Gemini CLI, this repository is structured to support other targets in the future (e.g., GPT-based CLIs, local LLM runners).
