# Calculation Tools (Static HTML)
A handful of single-page calculators built in pure HTML/JavaScript for quick financial what-if scenarios. No external build chain—just open the files directly in a browser.

## Files

- `early_loan_termination_calculator.html` – Model loan payoff savings when you end a term early and need to compare outstanding principal vs penalties.
- `lump_sum_calculator.html` – Compare applying a lump sum toward debt, investing it, or splitting across multiple goals.
- `money_sense_calculators.html` – Wrapper page that hosts several smaller calculators inspired by MoneySense charts.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file of interest in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
2. Adjust inputs inline; JavaScript updates the results immediately.
3. Save the HTML locally and modify the embedded scripts if you need to tweak formulas—the code is intentionally self-contained.

## Tips

- For more complex scenarios you can duplicate a file, customize the logic, and keep it alongside the originals.
- When hosting on an intranet or sharing, the files do not require any server-side logic; static hosting is sufficient.
