# Moneydance JSON → CSV Converter
Transforms a Moneydance `json` export into a flat CSV suitable for reconciliation or import into other accounting tools. The converter rebuilds the account hierarchy, resolves split transactions, and duplicates entries so both sides of a split appear.

## Key Script

- `md_converter.py` – Main entry point. Reads a JSON export and writes a CSV with columns for account, category, memo, cleared flag, and timestamps.

## Environment

No external dependencies beyond the Python standard library. A virtual environment is optional:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Running

```bash
python md_converter.py
```

By default the script looks for `md-all-data.json` in the working directory and produces `output_with_types_v4.csv`. Update the `json_input_path` and `csv_output_path` variables at the bottom of the file (or add `argparse`) if you prefer different names.

## How It Works

1. Loads `all_items` from the Moneydance JSON.
2. Builds a dictionary of accounts (`obj_type == "acct"`) and reconstructs fully qualified names using parent pointers.
3. Strips the root prefix (`"My Finances:"`) for friendlier account names.
4. Maps Moneydance account type codes (e.g., `b`, `c`, `e`) into readable labels (`BANK`, `CREDIT_CARD`, etc.).
5. Iterates over all transactions (`obj_type == "txn"`) and expands each split:
   - For single-split transactions, emits the original row plus the counter-entry that keeps debits/credits balanced.
   - For multi-split transactions, writes one row per split with associated memos.
6. Converts Moneydance cent amounts into currency strings rounded to the nearest cent.

## Output Columns

`Account, Date, Check#, Description, Memo, Category, C, Amount, Account_Type, Category_Type, ts`

- `C` is left blank so your downstream system can decide the cleared status.
- `ts` contains the original Moneydance timestamp for ordering.

## Customization

- Tweak `ROOT_ACCOUNT_PREFIX_TO_STRIP` if your Moneydance root uses a different label.
- Extend `ACCOUNT_TYPE_CODE_MAP` as you encounter additional code letters.
- Change `format_currency` to emit raw decimals if you prefer numeric columns over string-formatted dollars.
